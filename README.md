<h1>Thai Supreme Court Cases (TSCC) Dataset</h1>
<p>
This is a dataset from the paper "Predicting Judicial Decisions of Criminal Cases from Thai Supreme Court Using Bi-directional GRU with Attention Mechanism" which will be presented at the 5th Asian Conference on Defense Technology (ACDT 2018) in Hanoi, Vietnam.
</p>
<p>
TSCC comes from 1,000 criminal judgements from the Supreme Court Judgement Search System created by the Supreme Court of Thailand [1]. These judgements were judged since 1958 (B.E. 2501) using Thai Criminal Code B.E. 2499 (1956) [2]. Those judgements could be classified as three categories:
<ul>
<li>The offence against Life and Body like Murder, Manslaughter and Assault.</li>
<li>The offence against Property such as Theft, Fraud and Misappropriation.</li>
<li>The offence against Fame which is Defamation and Insult.</li>
</ul>
