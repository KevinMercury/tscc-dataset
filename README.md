<h1>Thai Supreme Court Cases (TSCC) Dataset</h1>
<p>
This is the dataset first appeared in the paper "Predicting Judicial Decisions of Criminal Cases from Thai Supreme Court Using Bi-directional GRU with Attention Mechanism" which will be presented at the 5th Asian Conference on Defense Technology (ACDT 2018) in Hanoi, Vietnam.
</p>
<p>
TSCC comes from 1,000 criminal judgements from the Supreme Court Judgement Search System created by the Supreme Court of Thailand [1]. These judgements were judged since 1958 (B.E. 2501) using Thai Criminal Code B.E. 2499 (1956) [2]. Those judgements could be classified as three categories:
<ul>
<li>The offence against Life and Body like Murder, Manslaughter and Assault.</li>
<li>The offence against Property such as Theft, Fraud and Misappropriation.</li>
<li>The offence against Fame which is Defamation and Insult.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
TSCC consists of two tables, Judgement and Law. Judgement table consists of 1,207 issues extracted from aforementioned judgements by the firmly effort of our expert. While Law composed of 122 legal provisions from 76 sections in Thai Criminal Code. We provide the .csv version which is suitable for model training and the Excel (.xlsx) version which is proper for analyzing data characteristics.
